# API between frontend and backend

## checkAuth

Check the user's permissions.


- **Path**: `/.netlify/functions/checkAuth`
- **Permissions**: Must be logged in.
- **Req Type**: `GET`
- **Req Body**: _none_
- **Response**: A JSON object with keys representing the permissions the user has.
- **Example response**:
```json
{"authorizedCaller":true}
```


## requestCall

Gets a location for the user to call. 'Locks' the location for 10 minutes so it will not be returned to other users while this user is calling.

- **Path**: `/.netlify/functions/requestCall`
- **Parameters**:
    - `location_id`: Override location selection. Pass the airtable ID of a Locations record (eg `recfPJuDROS46lPY9`) to skip the normal view selection code and return that ID specifically.
    - `no_claim`: Pass `1` to skip updating the record to lock it from other callers. Use this for testing.
- **Permissions**: Must have the `caller` permission.
- **Req Type**: `POST`
- **Req Body**: _none_
- **Response**: A single JSON object corresponding to the location to call. If there are no places to call, or some other error, the result will not contain an `id` field and instead will contain an `error` field.
- **Example response**:
```json
